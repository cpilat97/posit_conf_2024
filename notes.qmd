### Keynote - Updates from Posit @ 0900hrs

  - Updated versions of Quarto support `typst` for better, faster rendering of PDF docs. 
      - Fast, easy, customizable
      - A key power here is that html tables are easily converted under-the-hood and won't really break anything. 
  - Native `julia` engine now as well
  - TONS of quarto extensions 
    - Find Extensions - m.canouil.dev/quarto-extensions/
  - R for WebAssembly 
    - webR - executing R code in the web browser
    - webr.r-wasm.org
    - `WebAssembly`
      - Portable binary code format
      - high-perf webapps
      -most mod browsers
    - Shinylive 
    - `Quarto Live` - interactive docs & code exercises in Quarto powered by wasm
      - using a `webr` codeblock if you have the quarto webr extensions download
  - Snowflake & Databricks integrations
    - Infrastructure Management
    - Data Access
    - Application Deployment

### Positron Track - 1020 - 1140hrs

#### Exploratory Data Science with Python & Positron - Isabel Zimmerman

  - The data science life cycle doesn't really change even if the tools we use change
  - How does Positron support DS? 
    - Similar to RStudio - you have a sandbox w/ console, text editor, variable panes, and plot viewers
  - Interpreter selector that allows you to quickly select between python & r versions
    - Will remember per projects what versions of stuff you're using
  - DS is very experimental, iterative work: so you have an interactive, built-in console (much like R)
  - The connections pane give s you more information regarding what tables are in your db. 
  - Positron has a built in help pane much like rstudio, allowing you to grab the information directly in the IDE. 


#### Data Explorer in Positron - Tom Mock 

  - Summary Panels associated with the data viewer
    - Col Types, persistent filter bar, & summary panel
  - Data Viewer Grid
  - Grid design: R (dfs, tibble, data.table) & python (polars, pandas)
  - The code you write will automatically update the viewer (no more refreshing like in rstudio). 
  - Highly scalable: 
    - Handles millions of rows & Millions of columns
  - Sort multiple columns at a time and it will number them so you can keep track of whats going on. 
  - Auto column width
  - Filter bar sits outside the data with a designated design so it keeps you aware of things going on. 
  - Summary Panel design 
    - Type & name 
    - Missing data views so you don't need to do operations to find these
  - Upcoming: 
    - Sparkline histograms
    - Remote database conns

#### How Positron Works - Jonathan McPHerson

  - Why no build on RStudio? 
    - It was difficult to iterate on RStudio when trying to build out a polyglot IDE
    - RStudio is a 2 process sys. 
      - 1 process runs R, saves files, ui, etc... (which is why it gets slow when things are computing)
      - 1 process is electron - the browser
    - Python needs to run inside of R 
    - Theres also a choice between data featurues or IDE features
  - Positron is a fork of Code OSS
    - Which is the foundation of VSCode
    - Cursor AI Editor
    - and now Positron
    - what does this ultimately mean? You can sep the IDE and add in many things to it
  - Why not just build an extension to VSCode? 
    - Extensions are separate from the IDE, they're their own sandbox. So extensions are rather limited
    - Ephemeral & restarted any time
    - Stop running 
    - Doesn't make sense as a foundation for other extenstions
  - How does R & Py talk w/ these extensinos
    - R talks to the R Extension which talks to the VS Code API ( code completion & debugs) &&&& the positron ide for viewers, 
    - R & Python are treated as extensions...why is this important? When something Crashes, the ide just plugs along there's no restarting the entire ide
    - Allows Positron to extend to other langs in the future (eg `Julia`)
    - Theres a public API that anyone can write to and that can be brought to the positron core
  - Positron uses standard protocols for standard funcs
    - meaning they use protocols that are standard throughout the DS community

#### Introducing Ark, Modern tooling for R - Lionel Henry & Davis Vaughan

  - Positron is multi-lingual 
  - Scope now includes Python
  - Where is R left? 
  - Ark
    - Ark is behind all the auto completions that happen
    - When you're looking for outputs, it goes through Ark
    - Ark is: 
      - Execution: 
      - Assistance: Completions, etc...
      - Debugger 
  - Ark Execution: 
    - Think of code executions as a question. You hit `cmd + enter` asking the code question. 
    - Ark "answers" the question, displaying the results in the console
    - How does this work? 
      - Ark is a jupyter kernal
      - executes the jupyter protocol
  - Code assistance when writing R code
    - Code assistance could look like function signature
    - Code completion
    - Jumping to the function definition
    - Unique to Positron: 
      - Help on hover: in-line documentation
    - These features are similar to the code execution: asking questions & sending back answers. 
    - Built on the language server protocol. 
      - Eg send a "hover-request" send back a "hover response"
  - The "smarts" of Ark is from `tree-sitter` 
    - This is structured representaitons of code
    - The R grammer for tree-sitter needed to be built....which is what Posit did!
    - Github uses tree-sitter. 
      - Posit worked w/ Github to incorportate the R grammer tree-sitter protocol and it works across github now
  - The "debugger"
    - Debuggers allow you to step through code that's throwing an error. 
    - The debugger was implemented via a standardized set of questions and answers
    - The debugger uses the debug adapter protocol
    - Positron will bring you to the cpp code of dplyr
  

  **IMPORTANT** So it seems like one of the biggest advantages here with Positron is that it's implementing a lot of standard protocols that many other languages may have which means we can now take advantage of these protocols ALONG with R and benefit everywhere. 

#### Positron for R and RSudio Users - Jenny Bryan

  - Tips for testdriving Positron
    - Use **workspaces** which is a core concept, and tehse are just folders (analagous to `.Rproject`)
      - Once you're in a folder, everything kinda comes to life
    - Easy to use multiple versions of R and switching between them with fluidity. 
      - Console will always tell you what you're using
      - `rig` package
        - allows you manage multiple R installs (particularlly for macOS users). 
        - r-lib/rig
  - New defaults!
    - Blank slate lifestyle (no saved workspaces, etc...)
  - Command Palette is a core concept in Positron
  - Things that are available in panes in RStudio might be brought into the command palette of positron. 
  - Customizing your layout
  - Exentsions from Open VSX
    - indent-rainbow
    - project manager
  - The little flask icon is for your tests & `testthat`
  - 

The rsconnect publisher is an extension



### Strengthening the R Ecosystem

#### 20+ Years of Reading Data into R - Colin Gillespie

Larger files --> Data --> File Formats --> Engine --> Results

  - So now we have nanoparquet: https://nanoparquet.r-lib.org/
  - Parquet vs RDS: (example compare)
    - RDS uses gzip
      - 115mb
      - write speed: 27sec 
      - read speed 5.7sec
    - parquet uses snappy 
      - 143mb
      - Write speed: 4sec
      - read speed: .3sec
    - parquet also uses gzip (depending)
      - 105mb
      - write speed: 12sec
      - read speed .4 sec
  - `duckdb`
    - using dplyr + duckplyr
    - results
  - Why load data into duckdb? 
    - Its faster 
    - Repeated queries
    - Joins
  - lots of blog posts on jumpingrivers.com

    - Think about what users want to learn and whwat they might have questions about. 
    - Flip the way you think about the questions and what you want the app to do 
  - Why use shiny to do something? 
  - Why should i do that in shiny? 
    - Draw them in
    - Understand where data comes rom 
    - Show specific views
    - Have ways to explore their own data
  - What do you need? 
    - Understanding the data structure
    - Someone who can build the interface
